  Microtubule Disaster

Abstract: >
  Microtubule disaster is the rapid deploymerization of microtubule subunits. The polymerization of microtubule subunits is slow relative to the rate at which deploymerization occurs. The polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules is a multistep problem and allows opportunities for researchers to alter the parameters and characterize the results. 
  Our prior problem sets have given us the opportunity to explore the work done by [Garner, Zanic, and coworkers](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.037) in which they experimented with labeled and unlabeled tubulin subunits. The [current dataset](dataset1.csv)
